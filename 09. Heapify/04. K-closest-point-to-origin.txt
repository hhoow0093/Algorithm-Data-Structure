step 1 : construct a heap tree by appending ruples based from the distance and the points
step 2 : for every k ,pop the min heap tree and resturn the list of min heap tree.

import heapq

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        heap = []
        result = []

        for point in points:
            distance = math.sqrt(math.pow(point[0] - 0, 2) + math.pow(point[1] - 0, 2))
            heapq.heappush(heap, (distance, point))
        for i in range(k):
            result.append(heapq.heappop(heap)[1])
        return result
